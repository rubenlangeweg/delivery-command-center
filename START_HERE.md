→ **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** (28KB, complete onboarding)

**It contains:**
- Full architecture explanation
- All key concepts
- How to add features (with code examples)
- API integration details
- Troubleshooting guide
- "For AI Agents" quick reference section

**After reading CONTRIBUTING.md, you'll know:**
- Where every file is and what it does
- How to add any feature from the roadmap
- How to test and deploy
- Common issues and solutions

**Time investment:** 30 minutes reading = complete project understanding

## 💼 If You're Management (Dennis/Mark)

**Read this (10 minutes):**
→ **[EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)**

**You'll learn:**
- The EUR 118K problem (MCS overrun + cascade)
- The solution (predictive dashboard)
- ROI: 13.4× for Phase 1 (EUR 9K → EUR 123K savings)
- Decision framework (approve/reject/defer)

**TL;DR:** Tool costs EUR 9K. MCS cost EUR 118K. Question: Can we afford NOT to build it?

## ❓ Common Questions

### "What is this?"
Real-time project health dashboard. Shows budget %, PM governance, sprint load. Prevents MCS-style overruns.

### "Does it work?"
Yes. v1.0 functional in dev mode. v2.0 roadmap documented (20 features, 60h build).

### "How do I run it?"
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### "What should I build next?"
Top 5 priority (see FEATURE_COMPARISON.md):
1. Budget forecasting (already coded, 30min to integrate)
2. Team burnout dashboard (3h)
3. Slack escalation (2h)
4. Time Machine view (3h)
5. Historical pattern matching (4h)

### "Where's the code?"
```
src/
├── components/    # React UI
├── server/        # API integrations
├── types/         # TypeScript types
└── routes/        # Pages
```

### "How much documentation is there?"
76KB across 8 files. Code-to-docs ratio: 1:1.25 (heavily documented for AI agents).

### "Who built this?"
Hal (AI assistant) for Ruben (Delivery Director) at rb2.

**Lessons from:** MCS MVP 3.0, HocoParts, NuBuiten, IPN Sopral analyses.

**Inspired by:** The EUR 118K question - "Could we have caught this earlier?"
